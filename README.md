# ![icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toni20k5267/linkToSeletedText/refs/heads/main/icon.svg) Link to selected text
An extension for chromium-based browsers that allows easy linking to selected text.

## How to install
1. Download the zip file and unpack it.
2. Go to chrome://extensions and turn on the Developer Mode.
3. Click load unpacked and select the unpacked extension folder.
4. The browser should load the extension. That's it!

## How to use
1. Select some text(preferably an entire sentence).
2. Right click the text.
3. Choose "Copy link to selected text".
4. The link should be in your clipboard!

## Disclaimer
The extension might not work properly when selecting singular words or phrases that repeat on a webpage. I will not be trying to fix this, if it's possible to do so.
The extension also might not work properly with line-breakers, which is also not something I'm gonna try to fix(again, if it's even possible to fix that).




<sub><sup>Man the icon is shit asf I made it in Inkscape in like five minutes but whatever</sup></sub>
